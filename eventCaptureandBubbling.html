      /* *****EVENT CAPTURING AND BUBBLING*****

      Points To Remember:
      * When an event occurs, the element in which this event took place will be “target element” (event.target).
      * Then the event starts to move from document root to the element where event has occured 
       by handling the events..(Capture). If addEventListener has Capture as true then on its way
       from document root it will handle those elements.
      * Then rest of them having addEventListener(type,listener, false) will be handled.

            There are three terminologies to be known for handling events..
            1. Event Bubbling.
            2. Event target.
            3. Event Capturing.

        what is Event Bubbling?
        Let's consider there is a main div(1) inside this there is another div(2) tag.. inside this second div
         tag let's consider a p tag.... Now let's assume the div(1), div(2), and p tag are having
         eventListeners like onClick.. Now, when p tag is clicked it executes the given function and 
          then it won't stop here ....

          It will also trigger the div(2)'s onClick function... then this div(2) will again trigger 
          the div(1)...

        (From google:Event bubbling is a term you might have come across on your JavaScript travels. 
        It relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested
         inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the """same event"""
         (a click, for example))

          In other words bubbling will trigger events from where it was first handled.
        
            Example 1:
                Just to understand what is event bubbling.

                </body>
            </html>

            Example 2 : Just because you asked how to stop event bubbling!! :)
            <html>

                </head>
                <body>
                    <div id="parent">
                    <button id="child" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Child</button>
                </div>
  
                <script>
                    var parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
                    <!-- Add click event on parent div -->
                    parent.addEventListener('click', function(){
                    console.log("Parent clicked");
                    });   
                    var child = document.querySelector('#child');
                    <!-- Add click event on child button -->
                    child.addEventListener('click', function(){
                        console.log("Child clicked");
                    });   
                </scrip>
            </body>
        </html>


            Example 3:
            <body onclick="alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)">
                <button onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Click me</button> //This won't bubble because we are stopping the bubbling using event.stopPropogation method.
            </body>

            What is Event Capture?
            Did you understand the event bubbling concept??
            If yes, proceed or ask doubt!

            Event Capture is quite opposite to event bubbling, where in event capture if an element inside 
            parent tag is triggered firstly then in event capturing first parent tag will get triggered and
            then followed by child elements.

            Both of them differ at one place... 

            ***eventTarget.addEventListener(type,listener,[,useCapture]);***

            usually useCapture will be false.. That means that initially capture method is not used
            .. But if you want to use it explicitly then you need to make it true.. so that
            the outer elements get triggered first and then later child elements will be triggered.
