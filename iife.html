            1. Why use IIFE?
            Ans: The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy. 
                Because JavaScript's var scopes variables to their containing function, 
                any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world.
                
            2. What is IIFE? 
            Ans: It's abreviation is Immediately Invoked Function Expression!!
                 It's nothing but calling a function immediately after it is defined.

            example : (function(){
                console.log("hi");
            })();

            Wrong way(x) : function(){
                console.log("hi")
            }();

            ** The whole iife function should be written inside the paranthesis 
               because the values of that function should only be available for that function.. 
            ** They can't be accessed outside the function so that the global
               scope won't get dirty.
        */

      (function() {
        var letsCheck = "I'm not available outside";
      })();
      // console.log(letsCheck); This will give a error because letsCheck is born when that
      // function is entered and letsCheck will be dead once that function is executed.
      // (Refer hoisting for better understanding)!!!

      var letsGetName = (function() {
        var name = "Dhee";
        return name;
      })();
      letsGetName;
      // Now letsGetName will have the name.
