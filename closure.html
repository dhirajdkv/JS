            ***POINTS TO REMEMBER*****
            ** In js all functions have access to the scope "above" them.(i.e inner functions
            can access the elements of outer functions.)
            1. Why Closure?
            Ans: They are used in js for better data privacy(i.e the data inside one function
            can't be accessed outside that particular function), and they're used for event handlers.
            In closures Global variables can be made private using closures!!

            2. What is closure?
            Ans: ** A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
                In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, 
                at function creation time.
                ** Closure is nothing but writting a function inside a function that can access
                all the elements of outer functions.

            eg: var res = function(){
                var dhiraj = "dhee";
                function printing(){
                    console.log(dhiraj);
                }
                 return printing; 
            }
            var finalRes = res(); // this will print dhee in console.
        */
            var dhi = function(){
                var a = 10;
                c = 30;
                var first = function(){
                    var b=20;
                    console.log(a);
                }
                a = 20;
                (function(){
                    console.log(c);
                })();
                return first()
            }
            dhi();
